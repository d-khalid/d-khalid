Hello there, it's good to see you :D

I'm a 2nd year software engineering student, I've been programming for about 4 years in total at this point. I have way too many interests for my own good. My primary objective with making software is to make things which are useful and valuable for other people (or are just really interesting). I also like and am an advocate of free and open-source software, a huge amount of modern software exploits users in some significant way which I find very scummy.

# My Languages
- C#, usually my go-to for projects for ease-of-use and reliability reasons, I most often use Avalonia and ASP.NET Core MVC.
- C++, for the fast low-level thingies.
- Java, I know it fairly well though it feels like a more annoying version of C# 90% of the time.
- Rust, currently in the middle of learning it, I've only used it for small projects. 
- HTML/CSS/JS, for web development work (I find it kind of annoying but its necessary).

There's some minor ones such as bash and ones I've only used a couple times (Ruby, Vala)

# Some Public Repositories
- [IRis](https://github.com/d-khalid/IRis): A cross-platform AI-powered circuit simulator, it can make logic circuits from prompts and circuit images (work in progress)

- [TAnalyzer](https://github.com/d-khalid/TAnalyzer): Just an AI wrapper that can make transcripts out of therapy recordings, this was a mockup for a hackathon I participated in.

- [bfrs-jit](https://github.com/d-khalid/bfrs-jit): An interpreter for the brainfuck programming language, adding JIT capabilities was a little too hard for me at the time so this is still incomplete


Thanks for reading, have a good day!
